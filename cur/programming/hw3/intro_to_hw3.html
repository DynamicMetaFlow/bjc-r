<p><b>Reminder that you can work on HW3 in pairs.</b> Your partner (if any) that you work with in lab today does not necessarily need to be the same partner that you work with on HW3 throughout the next week and a half.

<p><br>Before beginning this lab, read over the <a href="http://cs10.org/fa15/assign.html?//docs.google.com/document/d/186x49Yd05JKztSwlSNv0S82Jy5w5ql_MVDLTZo-_mPQ/pub">spec for HW3</a> up until you get to <b>"The Assignment"</b>. Stop there.

<p>Now that you've read over the basics of the assignment, let's refine our understanding. Begin this lab by opening up the starter file. Ignore the existing code for now, you'll be looking at this code after today's lab is complete. Add a script to the scripting area with the following code (the "update display for" block is under Looks). Run it, and you should see a 2 appear gloriously in the top right corner (position 1, 4).

<div class="alert-success" style="padding: 10px">
	<h4>Do this:</h4>
	<p style="display: inline">
		Modify the script above so that it displays the board pictured to the right. This is an opportunity for you to use the 'set item' block and learn how the grid works for the 2048 game.
