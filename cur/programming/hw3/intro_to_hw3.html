<p><br>Before beginning this lab, read over the spec for HW3 up until you get to "The Assignment". Stop there.

<p>Now that you've read over the basics of the assignment, let's make sure that they make sense. Start by opening up the starter file. Ignore the existing code for now, you'll be looking at this code AFTER the lab. Add a script to the workspace with the following code (the "update display for" block is under Looks). 

<p>Now modify your script so that you have the following script. Run it, and you should see a 2 appear gloriously in the top right corner (position 1, 4).

<p>As mentioned in lecture, we're going to use a new HoF called test to verify the correct function of our reporter blocks for this assignment. To ensure we understand the provided blocks for HW3, let's look at some tests for those blocks

<p>We'll start with the item of block. To keep our main sprite uncluttered, let's work on the sprite called "HW3 Lab". Click on this Sprite, and you'll see a sample test. Try running it, and you'll see that the results are "true", "true", indicating that both of the tests passed. Make sure that this test makes sense before proceeding.

<p>Now look at the next test. This test ensures that "size of board" is consistent with "new board of size".

<p>Now let's start writing our own test fensure we understand the "rotated row for ___, ___ for size ___" block. This block is trickier to understand, so make sure to click the link in the spec under the "Description" column. Note that two of the three expected output values are blank. Your goal is to figure out what numbers go here so that the output is True. Try to fill in these numbers. DO NOT USE TRIAL AND ERROR! You will need to read the description of this block very carefully to understand what numbers you need to fill in. We recommend you use actually rotate a physical piece of paper to work out the answers.

<p>To ensure we feel comfortable writing tests entirely on our own, write a test for "score of the number". Make sure to test at least at least 3 different values.
