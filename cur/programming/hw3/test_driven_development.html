<p><br>One interesting programming practice is so-called Test Driven Development or TDD. In TDD, a programmer writes a test for each block before even writing that block at all. A substantial minority of programmers prefer to program in this way. To get a feeling for what it's all about, let's try it for this lab.

<p>Let's start by writing a test for the rotate clockwise block. In this case, we'll type in all of the values of the board. To make this easier, we've created a "new 4x4 board with values" block that you can use. Each set of four values between / symbols is a single row. 

<p>Fill in the output values so that the test is correct. Note that if you click on the block, it will return "False". This is because you haven't written the "rotate clockwise" block yet! One of the appeals of Test Driven Development is setting little challenges like this, and basking the glorious glow of the test telling you that you've passed the test.

	<h4>Do This:</h4>
	<br>
	<p>As the final step in this short lab, write a test for the "merge up" block. You should have at least TWO boards as input test cases (whereas our test for rotate clockwise only tried out one input board). Make sure you have your lab TA check off your test before you leave.
