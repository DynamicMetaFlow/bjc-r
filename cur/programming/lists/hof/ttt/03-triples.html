  <p>So we've decided that we'll  represent the board as a list whose items are in the order of the numbers above. If we have the board state above with X's and O's, our list looks like this:</p>
  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-list-basic.png" alt="example board as triples" /></p>
  <p>This list of winning triples is important to answer all the questions the strategy program will have to ask. Remember, &quot;can I win on the next move&quot; now means &quot;is there a triple in which two of the squares have my letter and the third square is empty?&quot; So you're going to translate each board position into a list based on <code>wins</code> in which each number is replaced by the status of that square: X, O, or the number (empty):</p>
  <p><blockquote><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/find-triples-numbered.png" alt="example board as triples" /></blockquote></p>
  <p>The picture doesn't show all of the result, just the first five triples. Make sure that each triple in the list reported by <code>find triples</code> corresponds to a triple in <code>wins</code>, with the square numbers replaced by what's in each square in the sample position. For example, the first triple in <code>wins</code> is <code>1 2 3</code>, and the first triple in the result is <code>1 O X</code>.</p>
