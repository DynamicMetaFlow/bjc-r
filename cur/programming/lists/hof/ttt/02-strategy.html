    <h3>
      Building the program
    </h3>
    <p>We're going to go through the program structure <em>bottom-up,</em> which means that you'll build helper blocks before you build <code>ttt</code> itself. But keep the goal in mind.</p>

      <h4><strong>Thinking like a Computer Scientist</strong></h4>
      <p>A good way to approach building a program: Design top-down, implement bottom-up.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Board Design</h3>
    <p>Remember on the last page, when we asked ourselves several questions about the game? Let's think about answering those, and how we could design the program to fit our goals.</p>
    <p><b>Question 1: What constitutes a good move?</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Before you continue, discuss with a neighbor what you think the most important rules for a good move are in tic-tac-toe.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We thought of a couple that are pretty important: (1) if we can win on this move, make that move! (2) if the opponent can win on the next move, block that move! (3) otherwise, prioritize the middle, then corners, then edges.</p>
    <p>Thinking about the first two rules, we'll probably need to check if we ever have two in a row and the opponent isn't in the third spot. That is, if we see two X's and no O's in a row, then we know where to move to win! Think about what condition we'd need to look for to block opponent wins.</p>
    <p><b>Question 2: What do I want my tic-tac-toe block to accomplish?</b> We know that we should input the current board and the player to find a move for. We also know that we want the output to be an indication of where we should move on the board. There are only nine spots on the board, what if we just numbered them 1 through 9? Then, out <code>ttt</code> block could simply output a number.</p>
    <p>This brings us to an important question: What should the board itself look like? Our board needs to store 9 pieces of information, mainly where X and O have played. What if we made our board a simple 9 item list, and put X's and O's on it where the players move? How should we represent the blank spaces? Well, we just determined that our <code>ttt</code> block should report a number representing the space where a player should move. If the empty spaces are simply their space number, it could make things easier for us!</p>
    <p><b>Question 3: How do you win tic-tac-toe?</b> You win by getting "three in a row". A tic-tac-toe board is 3x3. How many ways can you win tic-tac-toe? It's not 9— think about it.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Go on, count them</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Hmm, that's not very many ways! It's small enough that we could define them explicitly in our program. We'll call each row, column, and diagonal a triple. The program will need a list of all the winning triples. This is the sort of thing—an unchanging value that's needed throughout the program—that can reasonably be put in a global variable.</p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/winning-triples.png" alt="list of winning combinations" /></p>
    <p>Why is this a good way to think of things? Well now, "can I win on the next move" means "is there a triple in which two of the squares have my letter and the third square is empty?" This solves the problem we thought of at the end of answering Question 1.</p>

    <div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
      <p>Asking and answering questions beforehand allowed us to clearly define what we're going to do before we get started. We gained valuable insights that affected our design, and will make things go smoothly for us!</p>
