            Sometimes running python is be more difficult on some computers. Always ask if you're having trouble.
        </p>
        <h3>On Mac OS X: (including in-lab computers)</h3>
        <p>
            You'll be running python from the Teriminal application that we learned about on the last page.
        </p>
        <h3>On Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Python may not be set up properly on windows. If you are unable to get python to work from the command line (as explained below) here is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/faq/windows.html" target="_blank">link</a> that will help you get things set up if you'd like to work on your Windows machine.
        </p>
        <h3>Running Python</h3>
        <p>
            The first step is to open the Python <b>interpreter</b>. On the command line in your terminal, use the command <code>python3</code>. If you see something like "command not found", then use the command <code>python</code> instead. You should see something similar to the following:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
Alonzos-MacBook:~ alonzo$ python3
Python 3.4.0 (v3.4.0:04f714765c13, Month DD YYYY, HH:MM:SS)
[GCC X.X.X] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
        </code></pre></p>
        <br />
        <p class="alert quoteGreen"><strong>python and python3, what's the difference?</strong> When you open Python with one of these commands, check out the text that appears like above. You'll see something like <code>Python 3.4.0</code> or <code>Python 2.7.10</code>. These are just different versions of Python. Don't worry, both will work for this lab.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
            We're now using Python! Notice that we still have a <b>prompt</b>, but it looks like this now: <code>>>></code>. The <code>>>></code> indicates that we're using Python right now, and is where we can type Python code. After typing a line of code, hitting <code>enter</code> will tell the python interpreter to run the instruction. Try typing the following into the interpreter:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> 3 + 5
8
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>
            If the text cursor is on a line beginning with <code>>>></code>, the command line window has an active python interpreter open. <b>That means we can't do commands like <code>cd</code>, or <code>ls</code>, because the program is expecting Python code.</b> To leave the python interpreter, type the exit command <code>exit()</code> and hit <code>enter</code>.
        <p><pre><code>
>>> exit()
Alonzos-MacBook:~ alonzo$
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>
            Any functions or variables created in the python interpreter are erased when the <code>exit()</code> command is run.
        </p>
