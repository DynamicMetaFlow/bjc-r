        <title>Building a Markov Model</title>

    <body>
        <p>Your ultimate goal is to write a function build_markov_model(text, k) that generates a dictionary representation of a Markov Chain of order k for the given text. For example, <code>build_markov_model("the ether")</code> will return <code>{' et': {'h': 1}, 'the': {' ': 1, 'r': 1}, 'e e': {'t': 1}, 'he ': {'e': 1}, 'eth': {'e': 1}}</code>. Note that this is just a dictionary representation of our table from the previous page:
<pre>                frequency of           probability that
                 next char             
kgram   freq         e   h   r   t   
-------------------------------------
 the      2      1   0   0   1   0    
 he       1      0   1   0   0   0    
 e e      1      0   0   0   0   1   
  et      1      0   0   1   0   0   
 eth      1      0   1   0   0   0   
 her      1      0   0   0   0   1   
 ert      1      0   0   1   0   0   
 rth      1      0   1   0   0   0</pre>        
        </p>
        <p>
        To reach this goal, let's take things one step at a time. Let's start by creating a file called markov.py in our datalab folder. In that file, add the following function and fill it in. Test it to your satisfaction before proceeding.
        </p>

<pre>
<code>def get_kgram(text, ptr, k):
    """Returns the kgram starting at position ptr in a text. For example:

    get_kgram("hello", 0, 3) would return "hel"
    get_kgram("hello", 1, 3) would return "ell"
    get_kgram("hello", 1, 4) would return "ello"
    get_kgram("hello", 3, 4) would crash since 3 + 4 is longer than the string."""</code>
    </pre>
