            The length of the average word in a text is a proxy for the literary sophistication of its author. Create a new function average_word_lengths that takes a counts dictionary and returns the average length of words in that text.  
        </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
def average_word_length(counts):
    """Returns the average length of a text with given counts."""</code>
    </pre>

    <p>Make sure to test your code. When you've completed this task, get your lab TA to check your code.
