          One of the most interesting and important things we can do as a programmer is to manipulate and analyze real world data. Python is a particularly great language for data processing, because of the very powerful open source data manipulation libraries available <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific">online</a>.

          Installing such libraries is beyond the scope of this course (see CS61A and/or C8 instead), so we'll be working only with libraries that are built into Python. In this lab, we'll work with text data. 

          This lab will also give you a chance to develop a full python program totally from scratch (with no starter code).
